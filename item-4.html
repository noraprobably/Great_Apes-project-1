        <p>Platyrrhines are small to mid-sized primates who are close relatives to Catarrhines, but they differ in a few aspects. The most prominent phenotypic distinction is the nose, which is the feature used most commonly to distinguish between the two groups. The clade for Platyrrhines, means "flat nosed". The noses of Platyrrhines are flatter than the narrow noses of Catarrhines, and have side-facing nostrils.
        They are the only monkeys with prehensile tailsâ€”in comparison with the shorter, non-grasping tails of the anthropoids of Africa. Prehensility has evolved at least two distinct times in platyrrhines, in the Atelidae family (spider monkeys, woolly spider monkeys, howler monkeys, and woolly monkeys), and in capuchin monkeys (Cebus). Although prehensility is present in all of these primate species, skeletal and muscular-based morphological differences between these two groups indicate that the trait evolved separately through convergent evolution. The fully prehensile tails that have evolved in Atelidae allow the primates to suspend their entire body weight by only their tails, with arms and legs free for other foraging and locomotive activities. Semi-prehensile tails in Cebus can be used for balance by wrapping the tail around branches and supporting a large portion of their weight.</p>
